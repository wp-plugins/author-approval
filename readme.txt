This plugin allows authors to easily be assigned to pages(s) from one place to officially approve them. The Approver’s username, date/time of approval, and URL are recorded upon approval. The author will also have the ability to reject the page, which will allow the author to send an e-mail detailing their issues with the page to a specified e-mail address. 

== Description ==



Does your WordPress site have multiple Authors? Do you use WordPress more as a Content Management Systems (CMS)? Are you looking for a way to streamline the editing process of your website's pages? Do you have periodic 'Releases' of your site? If you answered yes to any of these questions, then this plugin may fulfill your needs. 

**Imagine the scenario below:**


You have a WordPress site with 100 pages and 13 authors. You release a new, updated version of your website once every month. You'd like an automated way to make sure that each and every page has been reviewed for proper content, typos, broken links, etc. before actually releasing the new version for the world to see. You'd even like to add some sort of accountability to the process, to see where the ball may have been dropped. 

With this plugin, you'll be able to assign each page to a specific author, whose responsibility it will be to review that page for accuracy. Once reviewed, the author will be able to 'approve' their page. Upon 'approval', the author's username, date/time of approval, and URL of page being approved will be recorded, providing a record documenting which pages have been approved, by whom, and at what date/time. If the author encounters any issues with their page (broken links, inaccurate information, etc.), they will have the option to 'reject' the page, which will allow the author to send an e-mail detailing their issues with the page to a specified e-mail address (preferably an administrator's e-mail, or perhaps a supervisor or project manager). 

**How it works:**

* Author Approval Process-

It's pretty simple. Those that will be approving pages must have their role set to 'Author'. When an Author logs into WordPress and clicks on 'Pages' in the dashboard, they'll see only the pages they've been made the author of. The Author will then click a page title, as if to edit the page. At the top of the page, they will see two additions to the Admin bar; an 'Accept This Page' link and a 'Reject This Page' link.

Once the Author has reviewed their page for any and all errors, they will click the 'Approve This Page' link. Once clicked, the button disappears; it's a one-time thing. The Author is then presented with a pop-up that thanks them for approving their page and informs them that all relevant info has been recorded. 

If they have any issues with their page and wish to make those issues known, they can simply click on the 'Reject This Page' link, fill out the form that will appear detailing their issues, and that information will be sent as an e-mail to a specified e-mail address (the e-mail address can be set on the options page for the plugin, which will appear as a link under the Settings section of the dashboard).

When an administrator logs in, they can navigate to the Author Approval Options page (which will display under the 'Settings' menu of the WordPress Dashboard), 
click on the 'View Approved Pages' button, and see a list of all pages that have been approved.

* Assigning An Author to a Page-

When an administrator is logged in, they can navigate to the Author Approval Options page, select an author from the drop-down menu, and choose what pages 
to make that author an author of. The pages that display are pages that the selected author is not currently an author of. Once the pages have been decided on, the administrator can click 
the 'Add Checked Pages' button, which will apply the changes. A list of all pages that user is an author of is then displayed. 

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Q: Does this plugin play well with other plugins?
A: Currently, this plugin may conflict with other plugins that modify the capabilities of the 'Author' role, but tht should be the extent of any incompatibilities.

Q: Where are the page approvals stored? 
A: When the plugin is activated, it creates a special table in the WordPress database, where ALL info for this plugin gets stored.
   When the plugin is deactivated, this table gets deleted, removing any and all traces of the plugin. 

Q: I have questions, comments, and/or bugs to report... how can I reach you?
